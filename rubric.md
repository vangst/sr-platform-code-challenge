| **Program Specifications / Correctness** | Program executes error free and correctly according to instructions / specifications.           | Program executes error free, edge cases may be handled sub-optimally or not at all.                         | Minor pieces of functionality are violated or incomplete.                             | Program only functions correctly in very limited cases or not at all.      |
| **Readability**                          | Code is understandable, well-organized and uses appropriate patterns for the complexity.        | Only minor issues visible (method or variable naming, linting disregarded or sub-par general organization). | At least one obvious issue / concern (linting, variable names, or code organization). | Major problems with more than 1 of (linting, variable names, organization) |
| **Code Efficiency**                      | Approach is optimized but balanced, the best tools were chosen for the job vs over-engineering. | Code is structured well generally, a few minor suggestions come to mind during review.                 | Code includes 1 questionable choice / decision or pattern.                            | Code includes more than 1 questionable choice / decisions or pattern       |
| **Testing**                              | Code includes well written test for all expected use cases                                      | Code includes well written tests for majority of significant use cases                                      | Code includes less than optimally written tests for majority of use cases             | Tests are poorly written, inaccurate or missing                            |
