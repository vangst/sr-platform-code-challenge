## Sr Software Engineer Questions: 

We try to do work asynchronously when we can. In that spirit we'd like to see how well you can explain the way you think in writing! 

Keep in mind your audience - we are your peers not your professor. 
Not to say we don't appreciate good grammar, but keep it light, let your personality come out, and maybe most important try to be efficient. 

#### Question 1: 

Let's imagine a scenario where you are a Sr Software Engineer working at Vangst, and you are working with your Product Manager to shape a new story to work on in an upcomming cycle. 

The feature request is to add a geolocation API. What questions do you ask? How do you define and or breakdown the work? 


#### Question 2: 

An open source library we've used in the application for months or more appears to have a bug. What do you do? 

#### Question 3: 

We're in the middle of a cycle (sprint) and your story was delivered earlier than expected. What do you do?
